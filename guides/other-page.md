# Other page

This page simply attempt to provide a link back to the main page in the same directory


## Relative links

Below is a link to the main page in the same directory using the classic markdown relative link syntax, ie `[Back to the main page](./introduction.md)`

Clicking on [this relative link back to the main page](./introduction.md), seems to work, but I suspect that is because the default behavior for broken links is to load the main page.
